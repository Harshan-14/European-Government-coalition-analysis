European Government coalition analysis
This python project is aimed to study the coalition dynamics in European governments using real time data available taken from REPDEM. Graphs are built using the libraries of networkx, matplotlib to represent relationships between parties and countries, considering factors like cabinet composition, types of federation etc. The finer intricacies like influential parties, potential coalitions etc are also taken alongside. The most important conclusion was that the holding together federation countries are more stable than the coming together federation countries.
